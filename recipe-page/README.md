# disclaimer

this is a simple webpage made as an exercise to practice react. the original design i tried to recreate is [here]().

# overview

the design is not very accurate to the original, but as it was just an excuse to practice react i didnt waste too much time on it. 

also, since i havent reached yet the part of the course that deals with event listeners and interactivity the page is not functional. 

i still tried to make it as responsive as possible, but it is a bit ugly on certain screen sizes.

but i think i got more familiar with setting react up for a project, and with the syntax to create components, so it's a success, i guess?
